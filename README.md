## Inspiration
Parkinson's Law: "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."

Working from home is pretty sweet! Feeling hungry? Grab a snack. Now you're tired? Take a nap. You've got so much more freedom now - but that's actually the problem. We either lose focus due to countless distractions, or burnout because we've spent too long on one task. Our solution is timeit. 

## What it does
Timeit uses the technique of timeboxing to encourage users to become as efficient as possible in their work. This is definitely not the first calendar scheduling app, but timeit is unique in how you schedule your work days - plan your breaks and fun tasks first; everything else goes around it! Furthermore, once the time is up, your tasks will be visually locked! Timeit is more than just a screen to visually see your tasks - it actually helps you complete them.

## How we built it
with lots of love a little bit of react, figma, web flow, material ui, firebase, scss, git, adobe suite, cinema 4d and lots of redbull.

## Challenges we ran into
TImeeee and running out of redbull :c

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The front homepage animation, the video demo (aka our baby)

## What we learned
buy more redbull
react, js, firebase, scss, django, 

## What's next for Banana Boat TimeIt
A hackathon - but not too soon, Recovery urgently needed ðŸ¤§
